A Pure CSS3 Cycling Slideshow


Thanks to CSS3, we can create effects and animations without using JavaScript, 
which will facilitate the work of many designers.
But we must be careful to avoid abusing CSS3, not only because old browsers do not support all of its properties.
In any case, we all see the potential of CSS3,here:
an infinitely looping slider of images using only CSS3 animation.
